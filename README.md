I stopped working on this project as I realized it's a waste of time to start it now. 
This is one of my dream projects and is a million-rupee costing project.
This involves iPadOS and iOS app integrations with Bluetooth, along with electronics, mechanics, and woodworking.

I will start working on this when I have enough money and time to create something extraordinary.
