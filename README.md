I stopped working on this project as I realized it was a waste of time to start it in 2022. 
This is one of my dream projects and is a million-rupee costing project.
This involves iPadOS and iOS app integrations with Bluetooth, along with electronics, mechanics, and woodworking.

I will start working on this when I have enough money and time to create something extraordinary.

I started this when I first began coding with SwiftUI, so this code has a lot of smells and has not been refactored at all. 
So, please don't judge me for this. It was a long time ago. 
I made it public so you can take a sneak peek at it. 
You can't contribute to this project as you don't have the context. 
That's why I made it public.
